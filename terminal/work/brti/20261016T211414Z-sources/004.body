The Market API provides access to market information, pricing, and settlement data.

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `GET` | `/v1/markets` | Get all markets with filtering |
| `GET` | `/v1/market/id/{id}` | Get market by ID |
| `GET` | `/v1/market/slug/{slug}` | Get market by slug |
| `GET` | `/v1/markets/{slug}/book` | Get full market order book and stats |
| `GET` | `/v1/markets/{slug}/bbo` | Get best bid/offer (lightweight) |
| `GET` | `/v1/markets/{slug}/settlement` | Get market settlement price |
| `GET` | `/v1/price-history` | Get historical Yes and No display prices |

## Key Market Fields

| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| `id` | Unique market identifier |
| `slug` | URL-friendly identifier |
| `question` | Market question |
| `description` | Detailed market description |
| `category` | Market category |
| `subcategory` | Market subcategory |
| `active` | Whether market is accepting orders |
| `closed` | Whether market has closed |
| `archived` | Whether market is archived |

### Pricing Fields

| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| `orderPriceMinTickSize` | Minimum valid price increment for orders on this market |
| `minimumTradeQty` | Minimum order quantity in contracts |
| `lastTradePrice` | Most recent trade price |
| `bestBid` | Best bid price |
| `bestAsk` | Best ask price |
| `spread` | Current bid-ask spread |
| `oneDayPriceChange` | 24-hour price change |
| `oneWeekPriceChange` | 7-day price change |

Use `orderPriceMinTickSize` and `minimumTradeQty` from the market response before submitting orders. Do not infer price tick size or minimum quantity from product type, symbol, or slug. For example, `minimumTradeQty: 0.01` means the market supports 1% contract increments, and `orderPriceMinTickSize: 0.005` means valid order prices move in half-cent increments.

### Volume & Liquidity

| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| `liquidity` | Current market liquidity |
| `liquidityNum` | Liquidity as number |
| `volume` | Total trading volume |
| `volumeNum` | Volume as number |
| `volume24hr` | 24-hour volume |
| `volume1wk` | 7-day volume |
| `volume1mo` | 30-day volume |

### Sports Market Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `sportsMarketType` | string | Fine-grained sports market type, for example `football_team_full_game_spread`. Same inventory as the Institutional `market_sport_type` field; see [Sports Schema](/trader-guide/sports-schema) |

| `gameId` | string | Sports provider game ID |
| `line` | number | Line value for spread/total markets |

### Crypto Price Market Fields

Markets that settle against a reference index price (crypto price markets) carry a typed `assetPriceTerms` object. It is `null` on every other market, including the hand-listed year-end Bitcoin markets, which show `marketType: "futures"`. Automated crypto markets have an empty `marketType` and `sportsMarketType`; identify them from `assetPriceTerms.marketType`. See [Crypto Schema](/trader-guide/crypto-schema) for the Institutional counterpart of every field.

| Field | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `assetPriceTerms.marketType` | string (enum) | `ASSET_PRICE_MARKET_TYPE_UP_DOWN`, `ASSET_PRICE_MARKET_TYPE_ABOVE_BELOW`, `ASSET_PRICE_MARKET_TYPE_RANGE`, or `ASSET_PRICE_MARKET_TYPE_ONE_TOUCH`. `ASSET_PRICE_MARKET_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED` means a newer type: render the terms that are present |
| `assetPriceTerms.asset` | object | `assetClass` and `symbol`, e.g. `ASSET_CLASS_CRYPTO` / `btc`. Its canonical form `crypto:btc` is the `assets` parameter of the [Asset Prices API](/api-reference/asset-prices/overview) |
| `assetPriceTerms.indexSymbol` | string | Reference index the market settles on, e.g. `BRTI` |
| `assetPriceTerms.horizon` | string | Cadence or window length, e.g. `15m`, `1h`, `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`. Display and grouping only |
| `assetPriceTerms.windowStart` | timestamp | Start of the measurement window. Set on UP\_DOWN and ONE\_TOUCH; `null` on ladders |
| `assetPriceTerms.windowEnd` | timestamp | End of the measurement window, i.e. the settlement instant. Use this rather than `endDate` for the settlement time |
| `assetPriceTerms.priceToBeat` | Amount | UP\_DOWN reference (open) price. `null` until stamped a few seconds after `windowStart`; while `null` and `windowStart` has passed, re-fetch at most every 2 seconds and stop after 60 seconds |
| `assetPriceTerms.strike` | Amount | ABOVE\_BELOW threshold; ONE\_TOUCH target |
| `assetPriceTerms.rangeLower` / `rangeUpper` | Amount | RANGE bounds, inclusive. The open side of a tail is `null` |
| `assetPriceTerms.rangeKind` | string (enum) | `ASSET_PRICE_RANGE_KIND_INTERIOR`, `_BELOW` (bottom tail) or `_ABOVE` (top tail) |
| `assetPriceTerms.direction` | string (enum) | ONE\_TOUCH: `ASSET_PRICE_DIRECTION_UP` (reaches the target from below) or `_DOWN` (dips to it from above) |
| `assetPriceTerms.settlementPrice` | Amount | Reference price the market settled on. `null` until resolved, and stays `null` on a ONE\_TOUCH market that resolved No: no price was touched, so none is recorded. Do not wait on this field for completion; use the market `status` or `GET /v1/markets/{slug}/settlement` |

Amounts are `{ "value": "81650.14", "currency": "USD" }` with the value as a decimal string exactly as stamped. On UP\_DOWN markets the long side (`Yes`) pays when the close value is at or above `priceToBeat`. Filter crypto markets with `categories=crypto`.

  For continuous order book updates, use the [WebSocket Markets Stream](/api-reference/websocket/markets) instead of polling these endpoints.
</Tip>

## Settlement

After a market resolves, query the settlement price:

GET /v1/markets/will-x-happen/settlement
```

Response:

  "settlement": 1.00
}

Settlement values are typically `0.00` (No) or `1.00` (Yes).
